# Nix-based Dotfiles

This is my managing of dotfiles and other configurations based with Nix.

To update things, use the following from this `/etc/nix-darwin` directory:

```bash
darwin-rebuild build --flake .#Borealis
```

## Structure

`aesthetics` carries aesthetic stuff: wallpapers, colorschemes, etc.

`config` is directly linked to `~/.config` and is the dotfiles.

`pkgs` carries a number of additional packages not in the `nixpkgs`. This is used,
e.g., to add some python programs.

`nixpkgs.nix` is `import`-able for defaulting as `pkgs`:

```nix
{ pkgs ? (import ./path/to/nixpkgs.nix) {}, ... }:
# ...
```

`overlays/default.nix` handles some common overlays --- extensions/modifications
to `nixpkgs`, including to `lib` and `pkgs`.

## Colors

### Stylix

I am using [Stylix](https://github.com/nix-community/stylix/tree/master) for
managing colors across applications. One slight problem is that you can't have the
normal default config file in use because of some collision with how Stylix
adds the colors (see [known issues](#known-issues)). Instead, use

```nix
programs.<program>.extraConfig = builtins.readFile <config file path>;
```

As a matter of standard, I prepend these file names with `hm-init.`. So, for
Wezterm, I use

```nix
programs.wezterm.extraConfig = builtins.readFile ./hm-init.wezterm.lua;
```

### Color Scripts

Color scripts are avilable under `./aesthetics/eyecandy/`. One particularly useful
one is `blocks` which simply displays 4-bit ANSI in a predictable order.

```bash
Plain:   black red green yellow blue magenta cyan white
Brights:   -    -     -     -     -     -      -    -
```

## On Applications

I think this is what's going on with Applications: First, [Nix-Darwin](https://github.com/grepgrok/darwin)
sets up the system. Among this is creating (empty) things (files or directories)
in `/run/current-system/sw -> /nix/store/[hash]-system-path` (creates in `...system-path`
and links `...sw -> ...sysem-path`) based on `environment.pathsToLink`. Now then,
Home-Manager downloads the file in the nix store (with the crazy hash
`nix/store/[hash]-home-manager-path/...`; see `home.packages`). Home-Manager then
links the `/run/current-system/sw/...` file structure (the `...`) to
`/nix/store/[hash]-user-environment/... <- /etc/static/profiles/per-user/$USER
<- /etc/profiles/per-user/$USER`. Finally, things get linked appropriately in
`/Users/$USER`. Importantly for us here, we get
`/Users/$USER/Applications/Home\ Manager\ Apps` (which are actually directly
linked to the original files in the nix store).

## Tips and Tricks

You can use `lib.mapAttrsRecursive (_: lib.mkForce) attrset` to apply `mkForce`
to the *leaves* of `attrset`. This is particularly useful when overriding a large
number of individual options without having to use `mkForce` on each and every
option; common in hand-resolving colors.

## Known Issues

### Stylix and config files

Many (all?) [Stylix](#stylix) color configurations involve writing to "main config"
files. For example, Stylix tries to write

```nix
xdg.configFile."wezterm/wezterm.lua".text = ...;
```

This conflicts (silently) with the way I include the config files:

```nix
home.file.".config" = { source = ./config; recursive = true; };
```

Typically, Home Manager's activation script with `home.file` catches conflicting
targets --- both for pre-existing files (which it just overwrites) and explicit:

```nix
home.file = {
    conflict1 = { text = "foo"; target = "baz"; };
    conflict2 = { text = "bar"; target = "baz"; };
}
```

As noted [above](#stylix), the most straightforward way to handle this nicely
while still being able to use the normal config file is to include it via
`extraConfig`. For example, with Wezterm,

```nix
programs.wezterm.extraConfig = builtins.readFile hm-init.wezterm.lua;
```

As a standard, I prepend these configs with `hm-init.`.

## TODO

- make `./config/nvim/lua/config/lazy.lua` downloading LazyVim more Nix-like
- appropriate modules across hosts and user profiles
- update READMEs
- use some `requirements.txt` or `setup.py` instead of manually adding
    the packages in `pkgs`
- [steam](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Steam)
- [obsidian](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/options.xhtml#opt-programs.obsidian.enable)
  - should just look into switching to [neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg)
- [chrome](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/429765/howto-install-google-chrome-in-nixos)
  - for when firefox doesn't work. mostly for [asbplayer](https://docs.asbplayer.dev/docs/intro)

- [brother iprint and scan](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Scanners#Brother)
- [TagStudio](https://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudiohttps://github.com/TagStudioDev/TagStudio)
- wallpaper sizer
- clear out unused applications
- finder open text files with nvim
- handle more apps. many should be deleted. Or moved to some workspace so they
    are only installed when I want.
- style:
  - [discord](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Discord)
