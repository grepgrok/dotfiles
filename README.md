# Nix-based Dotfiles

This is my managing of dotfiles and other configurations based with Nix.

To update things, use the following from this `/etc/nix-darwin` directory:

```bash
darwin-rebuild build --flake .#Borealis
```

## Structure

While not currently needed, the structure is set up to allow better modularity
in the future (largely bc that's what most people seem to do and it makes sense).
Basically everything lives under `modules`, except the flake. The flake basically
connects machines/systems/hosts to their appropriate configurations. I'm not
100% how this works but I'm pretty sure its based off checking the current hostname
and using the respective configuration in `flake.nix`. For example, on my MacBook
Borealis, it will select `darwinConfigurations."Borealis"`.

`hosts` manages... hosts. Devices in the network. In principle, this could be your
stuff on a big server like with DigitalOcean Droplets, a virtual machine, or, more
practically probably, your laptop. My MacBook is called "Borealis" so we have
`hosts/Borealis`. Now, these manage more system-wide settings. Things like printers,
(internet) networking, etc. If you think "this feels very operating system-y" then
it probably belongs here.

`home-manager` on the other hand manages user homes. Most prototypically,
dotfiles/config(uration) files. These are the things that individual people might
like to have to work with. Styling (Neo)Vim, terminals, browsers, music, git, etc.
Generally, each profile in `home-manager` should be usable across hosts without
having to change anything. Note that specifically this is for Home Manager
configurations. But that's pretty broad.

## On Applications

I think this is what's going on with Applications: First, Nix-Darwin sets up the
system. Among this is creating (empty) things (files or directories) in
`/run/current-system/sw -> /nix/store/[hash]-system-path` (creates in `...system-path`
and links `...sw -> ...sysem-path`) based on `environment.pathsToLink`. Now then,
Home-Manager downloads the file in the nix store (with the crazy hash
`nix/store/[hash]-home-manager-path/...`; see `home.packages`). Home-Manager then
links the `/run/current-system/sw/...` file structure (the `...`) to
`/nix/store/[hash]-user-environment/... <- /etc/static/profiles/per-user/$USER
<- /etc/profiles/per-user/$USER`. Finally, things get linked appropriately in
`/Users/$USER`. Importantly for us here, we get
`/Users/$USER/Applications/Home\ Manager\ Apps` (which are actually directly
linked to the original files in the nix store).

## TODO

- need to clear out some More
- make the update thing more in line with nix
- the functions are more typically nix-able (maybe, or a bashrc is the answer)
- move to zsh
- make zsh pretty
- appropriate modules across hosts and user profiles
